It's best to take it at the same time each day to maintain consistent blood pressure control. Since you're also taking Metformin twice daily with meals, you might want to take the Lisinopril with your breakfast to establish a routine.",

Walking for 30 minutes daily, swimming, and gentle yoga are all safe and beneficial. These activities help control blood sugar, lower blood pressure, and improve circulation. Start with 10-15 minutes and gradually increase. Remember to check your blood sugar before and after exercise, and stay hydrated!",
